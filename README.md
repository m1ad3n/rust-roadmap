## Rust Roadmap

### Purpose

The primary reason behind this repository is to support my learning of Rust in action. I started this as a personal learning exercise where I will go through most of Rust's features, syntax, and ecosystem by writing small scripts and projects that do something useful.

This repository will host a set of exercises, scripts, and projects that I, in turn, will create while working my way through the Rust Roadmap. Each script shall explore different aspects of the language, from basic syntax to advanced features, as I continue to grow my skills.

### Why Rust?

Rust is a systems programming language focused on performance, memory safety, and concurrency. It boasts big safety guarantees, mainly in memory management. it is one of the most common languages wherever low-level control is desired: systems programming, game development, and web assembly.

It is a good challenge for one who wants to grow as a developer to learn Rust. This repository will be a record of my progress while experimenting with the language.
